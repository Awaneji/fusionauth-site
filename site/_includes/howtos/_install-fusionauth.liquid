You'll need to have {{page.prequisites}} installed.

You'll also need Docker, since that is how you'll install FusionAuth.

## Download and install FusionAuth

First, make a project directory:

```shell
mkdir {{page.top_dir}} && cd {{page.top_dir}}
```
Then, install FusionAuth:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.override.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
```

TODO do we want to ship with mailcatcher so that email is taken care of?

## Create a user and an API key

Next, [log into your FusionAuth instance](http://localhost:9011). You'll need to set up a user and a password, as well as accept the terms and conditions.

Then, you're at the FusionAuth admin UI. This lets you configure FusionAuth via clickops. But you're only going to create an API key and then you'll configure FusionAuth using our Java client library. 

Navigate to "Settings" and then "API Keys". Click the + button to add a new API Key. Copy the value of the "Key" field and then save the key. It might be a value like `CY1EUq2oAQrCgE7azl3A2xwG-OEwGPqLryDRBCoz-13IqyFYMn1_Udjt`. This creates an API key that can be used for any FusionAuth API call. Save that off, you'll be using it later.
