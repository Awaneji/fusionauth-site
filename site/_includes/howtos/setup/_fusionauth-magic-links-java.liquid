Now, let's enable {{page.feature}}. Let's create another FusionAuth script, since to set up {{page.feature}}, all you need to do is tweak some FusionAuth configuration. First, go back to the `fusionauth-setup` directory:

```
cd ../setup-fusionauth
```

You'll use the same client library and API key, but run different commands.

Put the below code in `{{page.feature_config_script_location}}`.

```{{page.language}}
{% remote_include feature_config_script_content_location %}
```

You can run this:

```shell
{{page.feature_config_command}}
```

Now, test to see that you have {{page.feature}} enabled for your application. Close any other incognito windows you have open and then open a new one. (This ensures you've logged out of the application.)

## Manual Configuration

You can also configure {{page.feature}} manually by logging into the FusionAuth admin user interface and {{page.feature_manual_navigation}}.

{%capture alt_content%}Manually setting up {{page.feature}}.{%endcapture%}
{% include _image.liquid src=page.feature_image_file alt=alt_content class="img-fluid" figure=true %}


## Test It Out

Visit [the {{page.technology}} application]({{page.sample_app_url}}) and log in again. Now, on the login page, you should see a {{page.feature_singular}} button.

## Next Steps

If you want to click it and have it work, make sure you [set up your FusionAuth email configuration](/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/configure-email) using a service like Sendgrid or Mailgun.
