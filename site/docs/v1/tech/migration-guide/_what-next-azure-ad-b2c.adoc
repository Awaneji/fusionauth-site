If you are using the Azure Client Credentials Flow, which is still in public preview, and need to migrate Client Credentials grants, create Entities in FusionAuth corresponding to each Azure AD B2C app client that is configured to use the Client Credentials grant. The scopes within FusionAuth are currently constrained to a certain format, though there's an open link to https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-issues/issues/1481[GitHub issue to address it]. link:/docs/v1/tech/core-concepts/entity-management[Learn more about Entity Management].

You can migrate each of your Azure AD B2C app clients to a FusionAuth application using the link:/docs/v1/tech/apis/applications#create-an-application[Application API], which allows you to set your Client Id and Client Secret to be the same as they were in Azure AD B2C. Maintaining these values will minimize the impact on any applications using the OAuth Authorization Code grant or Implicit grant. Ensure you add the application to the correct tenant and allow the required grants.
