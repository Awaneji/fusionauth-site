== Overview

Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service for creating, publishing, maintaining, monitoring, and securing REST, HTTP, and WebSocket APIs at any scale. You can create APIs to AWS services or other web services

You can configure Amazon API Gateway to handle authentication and authorization to the resource through JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) issued on behalf of a user by an identity provider.

In this document, you'll learn how to set up Amazon API Gateway and FusionAuth as the identity provider to protect a lambda function running on your AWS cloud instance.

== Prerequisites

* A FusionAuth instance running on a publicly accessible URL. You can spin up a link:/pricing[basic FusionAuth Cloud instance] or link:/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/[install it on any server].
* An link:https://aws.amazon.com[AWS account]

== Set Up FusionAuth

Navigate to your FusionAuth instance.

First, you need to make sure the JWT issuer setting is correct. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Tenants -> Your Tenant# and change the issuer to the URL of your FusionAuth instance. For example, `\https://local.fusionauth.io`. Record this value, as we'll set it in the AWS Gateway API Authorizor later. 

Next, you need to configure an application which will issue tokens to access the Amazon API Gateway project.

Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and then create a new Application. Fill out the [field]#Name# field, then click the [breadcrumb]#OAuth# tab.

Make sure that the [field]#Enabled grants# checkboxes have the `Authorization Code` and `Refresh Token` grants enabled.

Your application should look like this.

Click the `Save` button.

Edit the new application. You should see a value in the [field]#Client Id# field. Copy it and put it in a text file. You'll use it in the <<Set Up Amazon API Gateway>> step.

== Set Up AWS Gateway

Navigate to your [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com), or create an [AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) if you haven't got one already.

Search for "API Gateway" in the top bar, and click it. 

image::api-gateways/aws-api-gateway/search-api-gateway.png[The AWS search for API Gateway,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Select "Build HTTP API" from the API type list. 

image::api-gateways/aws-api-gateway/build-http-api.png[Choose HTTP API build,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Name the API. This is for your description only, so it can be anything. Then click Next.

image::api-gateways/aws-api-gateway/name-api.png[Name the HTTP API build,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

On the "Routes" page, click Next without setting anything. We'll add the route via the Lambda function we'll create in a bit.

On the "Stages" page, click Next, leaving the defaults.

Finally, click "Create" on the "Review" page. 

A summary page for the API should appear. Copy the "Invoke URL" from the "$default" stage under the stages section. This will be the base URL for the API. We'll add a Lambda function next, which will give us a route to call. 

=== Create a Lambda function to secure

In the main top search bar, search for and select "Lambda". 

Click "Create function" to create a new Lambda. Name the function "privateFunction", and leave all the other options as the defaults. Click "Create Function" at the bottom of the page. 

image::api-gateways/aws-api-gateway/name-lambda.png[Name the Lambda,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Under the "Code" tab for the Lambda, click on the "index.mjs" file, and replace the contents with the following:

```javascript
    export const handler = async(event) => {

    const claims = event.requestContext.authorizer.jwt.claims;
    const response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify(claims),
    };
    return response;
};
```
Then click the "Deploy" button to update the Lambda. 

Click the expander next to "Function overview" near the top of the page. Then click on "Add Trigger".

Under "Trigger Configuration", choose "API Gateway" as the source. Select "Use an existing API", and then select the API Gateway, set up earlier, in the search box, and Select the "$default" stage. 

Under "Security", choose "Create a JWT authorizor". 

Set "Identity source" to `$request.header.Authorization`.

Under "Issuer", set the URL to be the same as you set in FusionAuth for the JWT issuer in the Tenant configuration. Make sure that it is exactly the same, including trailing slashes etc.

Under "Audiences", paste in the "Client ID" from the FusionAuth application created earlier.

Then click the primary "Add" button at the bottom right of the screen. 

After completing this, a new route will be added onto your Gateway API, with the same name as the Lambda, "privateFunction" here. Concat this name with the "Invoke URL" recorded earlier when setting up the API Gateway to get the full url. It should look similar in form to this: `https://w3miabt10d.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/privateFunction`. 

If you call this route, through a browser or Postman or Curl, you should recieve a 401, and an "Unauthorized" message. We'll create a token next with FusionAuth to show how the route can be successfully called. 

== Creating a token from FusionAuth

To access the the secured Lambda function, we'll need to get a valid token from FusionAuth. Normally, your front end app would redirect a user to FusionAuth to login, obtain a code, and then exchange that code for a token, using a framework of your choice. For the purposes of this guide, we'll call the FusionAuth API on behalf of a user to create a token directly. 

To enable this, there are a few settings that need to be changed on FusionAuth. In the side panel in FusionAuth, select "Settings > API Keys". Click the green "+" button at the top left to create a new key. 

Give the key a meaningful description, like "API Gateway Key". Select the Tenant that you created the FusionAuth application under (normally "Default").  

Then, under "Endpoints", select "Get"

== Set Up ngrok Cloud Edge

Log into an account with ngrok Cloud Edge enabled. Navigate to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/cloud-edge/edges[the ngrok dashboard] and then to [breadcrumb]#Cloud Edge -> Edges#.

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/ngrok-edges.png[The ngrok Cloud Edges configuration screen,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

Click `Create Edge` and select an `HTTPS Edge`. Click `Create HTTPS Edge`.

Copy the endpoint, which might look like `\https://pe07g5cn.ngrok.io` and paste it into the text file. You'll use that in the <<Test It Out>> step.

Click on `Start a Tunnel`. This will give you an `ngrok` command to run.

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/ngrok-start-tunnel.png[The screen with the start tunnel command,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

It'll look something like this.

[source,shell,title="Command to start the ngrok tunnel"]
----
ngrok tunnel --region us --label edge=edghts_2HhKN3ozOCbPO6eDYlXnUgUyiEn http://localhost:80
----

Copy and paste it, and then modify that to point to your web server. If you are following this document, you need to point it to port 8000.

[source,shell,title="Command to start the ngrok tunnel to the python protected app"]
----
ngrok tunnel --region us --label edge=edghts_2HhKN3ozOCbPO6eDYlXnUgUyiEn http://localhost:8000
----

Then paste the command into the same text file.

Next, navigate to the [breadcrumb]#OIDC# tab.

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/ngrok-configure-oidc-start.png[The ngrok Cloud Edges OIDC configuration screen,width=1200]

Click on `Begin setup`.

Configure it by taking the following steps.

* Add the URL of the FusionAuth server into the [field]#Issuer URL (Open ID Provider)# field.
* Put the Client Id you copied in the <<Set Up FusionAuth>> step into the [field]#Client ID# field.
* Put the Client secret you copied in the <<Set Up FusionAuth>> step into the [field]#Client Secret# field.

Here's how the configuration will look after you are done. 

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/ngrok-configure-oidc-end.png[The filled-out ngrok Cloud Edges OIDC configuration screen,width=1200]

Next, copy the value in the [field]#Redirect URI# read-only field. This should be something like `\https://idp.ngrok.com/oauth2/callback`.

Save the configuration.

== Finishing Up With FusionAuth

Switch back to the FusionAuth admin screen. Edit the FusionAuth application config, if you previously navigated away.

Add the value from the ngrok Cloud Edge [field]#Redirect URI# read-only field to the FusionAuth [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# field.

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/application-redirect-urls.png[Adding the redirect URL to the FusionAuth application configuration,width=1200]

Save the updated configuration.

== Test It Out

Now it is time to test the integration. Open up another terminal and start up the ngrok tunnel.

[source,shell,title="Start the ngrok tunnel to the protected app"]
----
ngrok tunnel --region us --label edge=edghts_2HhKN3ozOCbPO6eDYlXnUgUyiEn http://localhost:8000
----

Open an incognito browser window to ensure that you aren't logged into FusionAuth.

Visit the endpoint you copied above: `\https://pe07g5cn.ngrok.io`.

You will be prompted to log into FusionAuth.

image::api-gateways/ngrok-cloud-edge/fusionauth-login-screen.png[The login screen,width=1200,role=bottom-cropped]

If you login, you'll see the protected application. You won't be able to access it without doing so.

== Next Steps

There's a lot more you can do with ngrok Cloud Edge. 

You can configure the ngrok Cloud Edge OIDC module to force users to reauthenticate, expire after a certain amount of inactivity and more.

You can also combine the OIDC module with other security limitations, such as IP restrictions. You can also configure ngrok to proxy different paths to different applications and add or remove headers.

Finally, you can tweak your FusionAuth settings to ensure that the user is registered for the ngrok Cloud Edge application or fire off webhooks when the user logs in.
