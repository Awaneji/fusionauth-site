== Overview

include::docs/v1/tech/samlv2/_saml_idp_note.adoc[]

=== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have a running instance of FusionAuth and a working SendGrid application. You will also need admin accounts for both to configure them correctly.

> Single Sign-On (SSO) is available for Twilio SendGrid Email API Pro, Premier, and Marketing Campaigns Advanced plans only. See the Twilio SendGrid pricing page for a full list of Twilio SendGrid features available by plan.


=== Configure SendGrid

In your https://app.sendgrid.com/[SendGrid dashboard], navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> SSO Settings# and click [uielement]#Add Configuration#.

Name it `FusionAuth` and write down both [field]#Single Sign-On URL# [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# fields as you'll use them soon. Click [uielement]#Next#.

=== Configure FusionAuth

Before finishing configuring SendGrid, you have to create an application in FusionAuth. Log in to your instance, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications#, click icon:plus[role=ui-button green,type=fas] and name it `SendGrid`.

Go to the [breadcrumb]#SAML# tab and toggle the [field]#Enabled# switch. Paste the [field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)# and [field]#Single Sign-On URL# you copied from SendGrid to [field]#Issuer# and [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# fields in your FusionAuth application, respectively.

|===
|SendGrid|FusionAuth

|[field]#Audience URL (SP Entity ID)#
|[field]#Issuer#

|[field]#Single Sign-On URL#
|[field]#Authorized redirect URLs#
|===

Scroll down to [uielement]#Authentication response# and change [field]#Signature canonicalization method# to `Exclusive`.

Click icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your application. When redirected to the [breadcrumb]#Applications# page, view your application details by clicking icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas].

In [uielement]#SAML v2 Integration details#, write down both [field]#Entity Id# and [field]#Login URL# fields.

Copy the [field]#Metadata URL# and open it in a new browser tab. This will contain configuration you'll need shortly.

> Note: This address contains an XML file. If your browser doesnâ€™t automatically format it, you can copy everything and use https://xmlviewer.org/[an online XML beautifier].

Copy the contents of the `X509Certificate` element from the XML file and write it down.

=== Finish setting up SendGrid

Retrieve the first two values you copied from your FusionAuth application and write the [field]#Entity Id# to SendGrid's [field]#SAML Issuer ID# and the [field]#Login URL# in [field]#Embed Link#.

In the [uielement]#Certificates# session, click [uielement]#Add Certificate#.

image::https://twilio-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/sso-x509-cert-sidebar.original.png[Adding certificate in SendGrid.,width=1200,role=custom]

In the modal that opened, paste your FusionAuth application's certificate into [field]#X509 Certificate# and enclose it between `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----`, as seen in the example below.

[source,crt]
....
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
<contents of X509Certificate copied from FusionAuth>
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
....

Here's a walkthrough of these steps.

Go to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Teammates#, click the [uielement]#Add Teammate# dropdown button in the top right corner of the page and select [uielement]#Add SSO teammate#.

Fill in the same email address from a FusionAuth user and their first and last names. Click [uielement]#Next#. Choose one of the available permissions (e.g. `Add with read-only access`) and click [uielement]#Save# to add the user.

=== Testing

Browse to the https://app.sendgrid.com/[Sendgrid login page] in another browser or in an incognito tab and click `Log in with single sign-on (SSO) instead`.

In the dedicated SSO page, you need to fill in the username you created earlier and click [uielement]#Log In with SSO#.

You'll be now redirected to the FusionAuth login screen. After entering the credentials, you arrive back at the SendGrid application already logged in.
