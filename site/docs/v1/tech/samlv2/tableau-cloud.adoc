=== Prerequisites

This document assumes you have a running instance of FusionAuth and a working Tableau Cloud application. You will also need admin accounts for both to configure them correctly.

Finally, you'll need a FusionAuth user that you will use to sign into Zendesk. You can use an existing user or create a new user for this purpose.

=== Instructions

We also recommend taking a look at link:https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/saml_config_site.htm[Tableau Cloud SSO docs], but here are the instructions.

In your Tableau Cloud dashboard, navigate to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Authentication#. Select [uielement]#Enable an additional authentication method#, choose [uielement]#SAML# and click [uielement]#Edit connection# to open the settings.

Copy both [field]#Tableau Cloud entity ID# and [field]#Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS)# from [uielement]#1. Export metadata from Tableau Cloud# and write them down. You'll use them shortly.

Now, log in to your FusionAuth instance to create a new application. Navigate to [breadcrumb]#Applications# and click the icon:plus[role=ui-button green,type=fas] button and give it a meaningful name (e.g. `Tableau`).

Go to the [breadcrumb]#SAML# tab and toggle the [field]#Enabled# switch. Paste the [field]#Tableau Cloud entity ID# and [field]#Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS)# you copied from Tableau to [field]#Issuer# and [field]#Authorized redirect URLs# fields in your FusionAuth application, respectively.

Click icon:save[role=ui-button blue,type=fas] to save your application.

In the [breadcrumb]#Applications# page, click on the icon:search[role=ui-button green,type=fas] button next to your application to view its details. In the modal that opened, scroll down a bit until you reach the [uielement]#SAML v2 Integration details# section. Copy the address from [uielement]#Metadata URL:# and open it a new tab in your browser. If it hasn't automatically downloaded the file, you can do so by hitting `Ctrl-S`.

Go back to your Tableau account and upload this in [uielement]#4. Import metadata file into Tableau Cloud# by either dropping the file there or clicking [uielement]#Choose a file# and selecting it. Click [uielement]#Apply# to load the information from the metadata file into both [field]#IdP entity ID# and [field]#SSO Service URL# fields. You should see something like the image below.

Click [uielement]#Test Connection# to open a modal with the FusionAuth login screen. Fill in your credentials and submit the form. You should see a [uielement]#Successfully connected to server# message below that button.

In [uielement]#5. Match attributes#, map email, first and last name fields like shown in the image below and click [uielement]#Apply#.

=== Log in

In your Tableau Cloud account, go to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Authentication# (the same page you've configured the authentication above) and scroll down to [uielement]#Manage Users#. Click [uielement]#Manage Users# and then [uielement]#Add Users by Email# to send invites to the desired users. You must provide the same addresses they use to log in to your FusionAuth instance.

After doing so, they should receive an email with the correct address to log in. When browsing to that page, they should enter their email address and then be redirected to the FusionAuth login screen after clicking [uielement]#Sign in#. There, they should fill in the credentials for their FusionAuth account and when logging in, they would finally arrive at the Tableau Cloud dashboard.

=== Troubleshooting

Make sure you pasted the right information from [field]#Tableau Cloud entity ID# and [field]#Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS)# fields into your FusionAuth application.

You can also browse to [breadcrumb]#Settings -> Authentication# in your Tableau Cloud dashboard and click [uielement]#Download log file# in [uielement]#7. Troubleshooting single sign-on (SSO)# to further investigate.

Finally, you can edit your FusionAuth application, go to the [breadcrumb]#SAML# tab and click [uielement]#Debug enabled# to create an event log with more information. To see these logs, browse to [breadcrumb]#System -> Event Log#.
