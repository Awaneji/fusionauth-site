== Configure OpenID Connect with Cognito

[NOTE]
====
Cognito users must have a public email address configured to link on email (See link:/docs/v1/tech/identity-providers#linking-strategies[Linking Strategies for more on this]). An approach that will work for all users is to link on username or create an anonymous link. Using these strategies ensures that the configured Cognito OIDC connection works for every user, no matter their Cognito privacy settings.
====

Once you have completed this configuration, you may enable an OpenID Connect "Login with Cognito" button for one or more FusionAuth Applications. See link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/user-pool-settings-client-apps.html[Cognito - Configuring a user pool app client] for an additional reference.

=== Register a Cognito User Pool

If you're interested in connecting to Cognito, it is likely that you already have a user pool set up that you'd want to connect to. We're adding the steps to create a new user pool in this guide in the interest of completeness, or in case you would like to set up a test user pool.

You will first need to log in to link:https://aws.amazon.com[AWS].

Once logged in, search for "Cognito" in the main search field, and select the "Cognito" service.

- Choose the region you'd like the user pool to reside in from the top right dropdown.
- Click "Create a user pool".
- Select the pool sign-in options for Step 1. In this example, we are using email.
- Review the configurations for Step 2 up to Step 4 to make sure they conform to your needs.
- Give the pool a name in Step 5.
- Make sure the checkbox to use hosted authentication pages is checked.
- Choose a domain for the user pool.

=== Creating a User Pool App Client

To enable FusionAuth to access the user pool, we need to set up an app client on Cognito. In your user pool:

- Under "Initial app client" on Step 5, set the app type to confidential.
- Give the client a name. Weâ€™ve used "FusionClient".
- Set the "Callback URL" to `<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>/oauth2/callback` under allowed callback URLs.
- Under "Authentication flows" in the "Advanced app client settings" make sure the "ALLOW_USER_PASSWORD_AUTH" auth flow is selected.
- Check the box for your app name under "Identity Providers".
- Select "Authorization code grant" under "OAuth 2.0 grant types".
- Under "OpenID Connect scopes" select "OpenID".
- Review the attribute read and write permissions and then click "Next" to review the user pool configuration details.
- Scroll down and click "Create user pool".
- Once the user pool is created, click on the user pool's name and scroll to the "App clients and analytics section".
- Open the created app client and record both the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" which can be revealed by toggling the "Show client secret" button.
- The user pool and app client are now created and the next step is adding a test user.
- Open the user pool and under the users tab click "Create user".



=== Configure a New FusionAuth OpenID Connect Identity Provider

There is no pre-configured connector for Cognito in FusionAuth. The generic "OpenID" can be used though, as Cognito supports the standard OpenId Connect protocols.

Navigate to your FusionAuth instance. Select "Settings" from the sidebar, and then "Identity Providers".

Select "Add OpenID Connect" from the "Add" dropdown at the top right of the page.

- Provide a "Name", like "Cognito".
- Set "Client Id" to the "App Client Id" recorded when creating the app client on Cognito.
- Select "HTTP Basic Authentication" for the "Client Authentication" field.
- Set "Client secret" to the app client secret recorded when creating the app client on Cognito.

To retrieve the values for the various "endpoints" fields, visit:

```
https://cognito-idp.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<USER_POOL_ID>/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

Replace `<REGION>` with the AWS region code that you created your Cognito user pool in. This can be found by selecting the region indicator at the top right of the menu bar and recording the region code displayed alongside the region location.


Replace `<USER_POOL_ID` with the Cognito user pool Id. You can find this by clicking on your user pool.

Visiting the URL with your values templated in should show you values similar to these:

```json
{
  "authorization_endpoint": "https://fusionauth.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "id_token_signing_alg_values_supported": [
    "RS256"
  ],
  "issuer": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/us-east-2_DFiufNrjlT",
  "jwks_uri": "https://cognito-idp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/us-east-2_DFiufNrjlT/.well-known/jwks.json",
  "response_types_supported": [
    "code",
    "token"
  ],
  "scopes_supported": [
    "openid",
    "email",
    "phone",
    "profile"
  ],
  "subject_types_supported": [
    "public"
  ],
  "token_endpoint": "https://fusionauth.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/token",
  "token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported": [
    "client_secret_basic",
    "client_secret_post"
  ],
  "userinfo_endpoint": "https://fusionauth.auth.us-east-2.amazoncognito.com/oauth2/userInfo"
}
```

NOTE: Ensure that the Domain name set earlier in the app client configuration appears in these endpoint URLs. If it does not, wait for a while for the URLs to update. There may be a lag between setting the domain and the domain reflecting in the URLs.

Copy the endpoints from this output into the corresponding fields in the FusionAuth config.

Set "Button Text" to "Login with Cognito". You can also upload a Cognito icon as the button icon if you wish.

Set the "Scope" field to "openid". Choose "Link on email. Create the user if they do not exist" for the "Linking Strategy".

Choose "No Lambda" for the "Reconcile Lambda field".

Now choose the applications you would like the Cognito sign-in to be available to.

==== Testing

To test, navigate to the applications page in FusionAuth. Click on the "View" icon (magnifying glass) next to the application you enabled Cognito login on and copy the "OAuth IdP login URL" address. Navigate to this address. You should see a "Login with Cognito" option on your app's sign-in page:

image::identity-providers/cognito/cognito-login-fusionauth-button.png[Cognito log in on FusionAuth, width=1200]

Click on the "Login with Cognito" button. Test logging in with the username and password added when creating the user pool on Cognito. If it is all set up correctly, you should be redirected back to your app, successfully logged in.
