Next we'll import and modify the files from the 5-minute guide that let us launch and run our FusionAuth instance.

First, download the Docker files.

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
```

To enable Kickstart to run from this `docker-compose.yml` file, we must make some modifications. They are described in detail at https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker#kickstart[this link] and copied here for your convenience:

- In the `volumes:` section of the FusionAuth service, add `- ./kickstart:/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart`.

- Modify `.env` and add the Kickstart configuration variable: `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE=/usr/local/fusionauth/kickstart/kickstart.json`. This path should be what the Docker container expects, not the path on the host.

- Configure `docker-compose.yml` to pass the environment variable set by `.env` to the container. Do this by adding `FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE: ${FUSIONAUTH_APP_KICKSTART_FILE}` to the `environment` section of the FusionAuth service.

Now download the 5-minute guide files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-example-5-minute-guide \
&& cd fusionauth-example-5-minute-guide
```

This folder contains a file called `.env.sample`:

```env
CLIENT_ID=CHANGEME
CLIENT_SECRET=CHANGEME
BASE_URL=http://localhost:9011
```

Change the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` so that they match the `applicationId` and `clientSecret` variables from your `kickstart.json` file. Then save the file as `.env`

```env
CLIENT_ID=404e516b-06b8-49da-9c68-c1cd1928c81d
CLIENT_SECRET=RBLhJrfRsa0-YxVPrn_aZfzIGccWyncdvHvDNTy-Hrs
BASE_URL=http://localhost:9011
```
