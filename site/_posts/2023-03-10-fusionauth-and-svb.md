This week, SVB bank ran into major issues due to the federal reserve's planned rate hikes. After a large drop in its share price and a couple of key industry figures telling companies to pull out their money, trading has been halted, the bank has been suspended, and the government has stepped in to sort through the mess.

As many VC backed startups that bank with SVB are likely frantically trying to figure out if they'll have access to the money they borrowed from investors, FusionAuth has a dramatically different story to share.

## Our history

As the founder of the company, I started the company back in 2007 with the idea of building great software that companies could actually use. I wasn't looking for someone to write me a $90M check in hopes that I would someday figure out a product the industry needed. Instead, I built a tool based on my own needs. This tool was [CleanSpeak](https://cleanspeak.com) and it is still an awesome business that continues to provide value to this day. The company was immediately profitable because we had to be. How could I pay salaries unless companies purchased licenses for our software? For years, we continued to grow the CleanSpeak business and as we made money, we built out the team.

In 2016 or so, Daniel DeGroff and I started working on what eventually became FusionAuth. CleanSpeak was generating great revenue and this allowed us to build FusionAuth without taking on any debt. In 2018, we finally launched FusionAuth and began selling support for it. As FusionAuth gained popularity, we continued to add great customers, increased revenue, and hired awesome employees to help us build. To this day, we've built the company this way.

## The VC Model

The VC model is quite different. It generally starts with a rough idea or an MVP (minimally viable product). Investors then write large checks to help the founders expand. This might include hiring more employees to help build the product or to generate leads and make sales.

VC backed companies generally run at a significant lose because they are always spending more than they are making. This spend is usually a combination of paying employees and spending on marketing. The goal is to eventually generate more revenue then the company is burning. This type of success is rare though and many companies will instead raise more and more money to continue covering their bills while they attempt to grow.

## SVB and FusionAuth

Since we never raised money from VCs or needed any type of debt financing, SVB was not a great bank for us. Instead, we've been banking with Chase for over a decade. Chase is a great bank for bootstrapped and profitable businesses because they understand the fundamentals of businesses outside of large funding rounds.

While the SVB issues are going to leave a lasting mark on the industry, FusionAuth is in a great position to continue providing value. We are bootstrapped, which means we aren't going to instantly disappear overnight or layoff most of our employees. We are profitable, so we pay our employees and cover all our expenses. Plus, we always have money left over each year, which we save in case we need it. And we are still growing, despite all of the issues the world is facing right now.

Trusting your login to a third party can be a hard decision because it is a mission critical component. Picking the right company to work with can be challenging. If you need an industry leading vendor that is guaranteed not to disappear on you, FusionAuth is probably your best bet!
