In this tutorial, we'll create FusionAuth User Actions to flag a user, and send emails and webhook notifications, when they buy temporary access to a news site.

<!--more-->

User Actions in FusionAuth can be quite powerful. They are often used to temporarily disable access to a user upon some infringement or account review. However, they can be used in positive scenarios as well. We'll model a common type of scenario in this tutorial: A user buys temporary access to a news site. You can apply a FusionAuth User Action which broadcasts that to all the sister news sites, which can now try to upsell the user to buy a subscription, as well as send an email to the user thanking them. When the user's access expires, User Actions can send an automatic email thanking them.

## Prerequisites

We'll explain nearly everything that we use, but we expect you to have:

- Docker and Docker Compose set up as we'll set up FusionAuth using these.
- [cURL](https://curl.se), or [Postman](https://www.postman.com), or a similar tool installed to send test HTTP requests to the FusionAuth API.

## Installing and configuring FusionAuth with Docker Compose

There are [various ways](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/fusionauth-app) to install FusionAuth depending on your system, but the easiest way is to use Docker and Docker Compose. Instructions are [here](/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker). Currently, if you have Docker installed, you can run the following commands to install and run FusionAuth:

```bash
curl -o docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/docker-compose.yml
curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FusionAuth/fusionauth-containers/master/docker/fusionauth/.env
docker-compose up
```

Note that here we use a public `.env` file containing hard-coded database passwordsâ€”this is not suitable for production use.

### Configuring FusionAuth

FusionAuth should now be running and reachable on your chosen URL or `http://localhost:9011` if you've installed it locally. The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up an admin user and password.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-initial-setup.png" alt="FusionAuth initial setup user and password" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Once you've done this, you'll be prompted to complete three more set-up steps, as shown below.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/fusionauth-setup.png" alt="FusionAuth prompts us with the setup steps that we need to complete." class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Sending emails to communicate to the user about their purchase is a vital part of this tutorial, so you'll want to set that up. Read more about setting up [email on FusionAuth here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/configure-email). If you are running locally, you can use a mock SMTP email server like [MailCatcher](https://mailcatcher.me)

### Creating an application

Click "Setup" under "Missing Application" and call your new app "Silicon Valley Chronicle" or another name of your choice. Select a "Tenant" if you've set more than one up already.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-add-application.png" alt="FusionAuth Add Application" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

Click the "Save" button at the top right for your changes to take effect.

### Creating a user
 
Two users are required for a User Action to take effect: an `actioner` and an `actionee`. The `actioner` will be the admin user that you created when you set up FusionAuth for the first time. The `actionee` will be the user who buys temporary access to our news site.
 
To create a user, navigate to "Users" and click the "Add" button. Then supply an email address. You can untoggle the "Send email to set up password" switch to supply a password straight away.

Record the Id's of both users.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-create-user.png" alt="Create User" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
### Creating an API Key
 
We will create and execute our User Action through API calls, so we need to set up an API Key. Navigate to "Settings" then "API Keys" and click the "Add" button. Make sure `POST` is enabled for both the `/api/user-action` and `/api/user/action` endpoints. We will use the former to create our User Action and the latter to execute it.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-create-api-key.png" alt="Create API Key" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
Record the value of your API Key.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-api-key-created.png" alt="API Key Created" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
### Creating email templates
 
Our User Action will send four different emails to the `actionee` upon four different conditions: when they `sign up`, if they `modify` or `cancel` their subscription, and when that subscription `expires`. Create four email templates for each of these conditions and record their Id under "Customizations" then "Email Templates". More information on email templates in FusionAuth can be found [here](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/email-templates/email-templates#overview).
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-email-templates.png" alt="Email Templates" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
### Creating the User Action
 
We can now create a [user action definition](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/user-actions) with the email template Ids and `POST` to the `/api/user-action` route. Setting the `temporal` attribute to `true` allows us to set an `expiry` time when we execute the action on a user. This means that the action will automatically be removed from the user after the time set in `expiry`. We can also set `sendEndEvent` to `true` so that we can be notified via webhook when the access period has expired.
 
```sh
curl --location --request POST 'https://<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>/api/user-action' \
 --header 'Authorization: <YOUR API KEY>' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-raw '{
 "userAction": {
  "name": "Bought Temporary Access",
  "startEmailTemplateId": "5eaf58e7-2e5a-4eea-94b8-74a707724f7b",
  "endEmailTemplateId": "18490dc2-b3d4-462f-9a8e-882b4fb4e76f",
  "modifyEmailTemplateId": "2011460f-bd11-4134-ba8a-9d4c6c4a23ae",
  "cancelEmailTemplateId": "981a1ecf-4a1d-44b8-8211-3215cb80319f",
  "temporal": true,
  "userEmailingEnabled": true,
  "sendEndEvent": true
  }
 }'
```

Replace `<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>` with the URL of your FusionAuth instance, `<YOUR API KEY>` with the API key noted earlier as well as the `startEmailTemplateId`, `endEmailTemplateId`, `modifyEmailTemplateId` and `cancelEmailTemplateId` with appropriate values, in the command above.
FusionAuth should return something similar to the following:

```json
{
 "userAction": {
  "active": true,
  "cancelEmailTemplateId": "981a1ecf-4a1d-44b8-8211-3215cb80319f",
  "endEmailTemplateId": "18490dc2-b3d4-462f-9a8e-882b4fb4e76f",
  "id": "6f4115c0-3db9-4734-aeda-b9c3f7dc4269",
  "includeEmailInEventJSON": false,
  "insertInstant": 1674937446558,
  "lastUpdateInstant": 1674937446558,
  "modifyEmailTemplateId": "2011460f-bd11-4134-ba8a-9d4c6c4a23ae",
  "name": "Bought Temporary Access",
  "options": [],
  "preventLogin": false,
  "sendEndEvent": true,
  "startEmailTemplateId": "5eaf58e7-2e5a-4eea-94b8-74a707724f7b",
  "temporal": true,
  "transactionType": "None",
  "userEmailingEnabled": true,
  "userNotificationsEnabled": false
 }
}
```

Record the `id` value. Here, it is `6f4115c0-3db9-4734-aeda-b9c3f7dc4269`. You can verify that the User Action was created by going to "Settings" then "User Actions" in the FusionAuth admin portal.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-user-action-created.png" alt="User Action Created" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
### Setting up Webhooks

In order to propagate a message when a user action is taken to our sister news sites, we can set up a webhook. To do this, we can navigate to "Settings" then "Webhooks" and click the "Add" button. To simulate the endpoint of our sister news site that will consume the user action information, we will use [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site). Upon visiting this page, it will generate a unique URL of the form `https://webhook.site/<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SITE_ID>`. Copy this URL into the "URL" field.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-add-webhook.png" alt="Add Webhook" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
Scroll down and make sure that the `user.action` event is enabled.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-webhook-switch.png" alt="Webhook event switch" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
Then, select the "Tenants" tab and select your tenant. Alternatively, you can select "All tenants".
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-webhook-tenant.png" alt="Enable tenant on webhook page" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
Navigate to "Tenants" then "Your tenant" and select the "Webhooks" tab. Make sure that the webhook is enabled. If you selected "All tenants" on the webhook page, its checkbox will be disabled.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-tenants-webhooks.png" alt="Webhook enabled on tenants page" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
Scroll down and make sure the `user.action` event is enabled here as well.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-tenants-switch.png" alt="Tenant event switch" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
### Executing the User Action
 
Now you can [apply the action](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/actioning-users) to a specific user with the `api/user/action` endpoint. The `expiry` time follows the UNIX epoch format in milliseconds. Make sure the `actioneeUserId`, `actionerUserId`, and `userActionId` values match the ones you recorded in the previous steps as well as to update the `expiry` to a future timestamp.
 
```sh
curl --location --request POST 'https://<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>/api/user/action' \
 --header 'Authorization: <YOUR API KEY>' \
 --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 --data-raw '{
  "broadcast": true,
  "action": {
  "actioneeUserId": "12e22430-162c-4f7e-bf40-58f7a69a26ce",
  "actionerUserId": "5ea819ea-6ff1-4b17-943f-eb2d1c246c3b",
  "comment": "Signed up for 24 hour premium access",
  "emailUser": true,
  "expiry": 1674903995472,
  "userActionId": "fbff792c-2340-4d72-b4fd-534f94d0a94b"
  }
 }'
```

FusionAuth should reply with 200 OK:

```json
{
 "action": {
  "actioneeUserId": "12e22430-162c-4f7e-bf40-58f7a69a26ce",
  "actionerUserId": "5ea819ea-6ff1-4b17-943f-eb2d1c246c3b",
  "applicationIds": [],
  "comment": "Signed up for 24 hour premium access",
  "emailUserOnEnd": true,
  "expiry": 1674939392664,
  "id": "8ed1f910-4e62-4dd1-a88e-e45964b56e21",
  "insertInstant": 1674938412450,
  "localizedName": "Bought Temporary Access",
  "name": "Bought Temporary Access",
  "notifyUserOnEnd": false,
  "userActionId": "6f4115c0-3db9-4734-aeda-b9c3f7dc4269"
 }
}
```

Upon executing this action, the `actionee` will receive an email thanking them for their subscription.
 
{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-email.png" alt="Email confirmation" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}
 
You can also verify that the request was propagated to the sister news site by checking `https://webhook.site/!#/<YOUR_WEBHOOK_SITE_ID>`. You will see the body of your request in the "Raw Content" field.

{% include _image.liquid src="/assets/img/blogs/fusionauth-user-actions/user-actions-webhook-site.png" alt="Webhook confirmation" class="img-fluid" figure=false %}

When the action expires, the webhook will be fired again.
 
### Querying Action status on a User

Depending on how you control access to your articles, you might want to check the user to see if they have temporary access actioned. You can do this by [querying the actions API](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/actioning-users#retrieve-a-previously-taken-action) and filtering by user and Action:

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'https://<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>/api/user/action?userId=<USER_ID>&active=true' \
--header 'Authorization: <YOUR API KEY>'
```

Replace `<YOUR_FUSIONAUTH_URL>` , `<YOUR API KEY>` and `<USER_ID>` with the appropriate values. 

FusionAuth will return an object with an array of all actions currently active on the user. You can filter to find if there are any with the `userActionId` of the user action set up above, to test if the user has temporary access:

```sh
{
    "actions": [
        {
            "actioneeUserId": "12e22430-162c-4f7e-bf40-58f7a69a26ce",
            "actionerUserId": "5ea819ea-6ff1-4b17-943f-eb2d1c246c3b",
            "applicationIds": [
                "af4847c4-d183-4e51-ab8a-ce8940909127"
            ],
            "comment": "Signed up for 24 hour premium access",
            "emailUserOnEnd": true,
            "endEventSent": false,
            "expiry": 1675890993000,
            "id": "30e05e8f-fba6-4dd3-852c-abbc2d2e2461",
            "insertInstant": 1675322145449,
            "localizedName": "Bought Temporary Access",
            "name": "Bought Temporary Access",
            "notifyUserOnEnd": false,
            "userActionId": "6f4115c0-3db9-4734-aeda-b9c3f7dc4269"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Conclusion
 
In this tutorial, we used User Actions to flag and email users who buy temporary access to our news site. We also propagate that request to sister news sites so that they can upsell the user as well.
